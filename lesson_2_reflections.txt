## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

This creates an empty .git directory which will hold the information describing the repository.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

In some sense it is more transitory (staging). It only tracks the existence of files I think rather
than their contents the way the repository and workind directory will. It provides the advantage
of allowing the user to take their time and check the progress of the project as they prepare to
make a commit.
