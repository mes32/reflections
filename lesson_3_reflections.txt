## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be very useful when collaborating with someone else remotely. A 
remote repository serves as a backup. It also provides an additional level of redundancy
since the files are physically stored in two places.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

If changes were automatic then code you are working on might change out from under you and cause
confusion. Possibly this could work if there were a second (remote) staging area, but in the end 
that wouldn't be that different from just leaving the changes on the remote working directory. 

## Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
another?

A clone is a copy of a repository. Branches are different named paths through the commit history of
a single repository. Forks are a type of clone. The fork functionality is provided by Github as an 
additional feature not found in Git itself. A fork clones a repository on Github's server from one 
user's account to another and logs this clone as a way of providing attribution and/or social connectivity between the repositories.
