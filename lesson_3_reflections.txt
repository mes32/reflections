## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository would be very useful when collaborating with someone else remotely. A 
remote repository serves as a backup. It also provides an additional level of redundancy
since the files are physically stored in two places.

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

If changes were automatic then code you are working on might change out from under you and cause
confusion. Possibly this could work if there were a second (remote) staging area, but in the end 
that wouldn't be that different from just leaving the changes on the remote working directory.
